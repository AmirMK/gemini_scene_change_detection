# ðŸŽ¬ Scene Change Detection App

This is a Streamlit app that uses **Googleâ€™s Gemini models** to analyze videos stored in a Google Cloud Storage bucket and detect **scene changes** (shot boundaries).  
The app identifies the **best points for ad placement** across a movie or video and returns detailed metadata (timestamp, reason, transition type, narrative type, etc.).

On the UI:
- **Sidebar** lets you select:
  - GCP project ID (default: `vertex-ai-search-v2`)
  - Gemini model (`gemini-2.5-flash`, `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`, or `gemini-2.5-pro`)
  - Video file from a public GCS bucket or a custom URL
- **Main area** displays results:
  - Each scene change is shown in a row with:
    - Left: the video starting from the detected timestamp (paused until user plays)
    - Right: structured JSON metadata for that scene
- A **Download CSV** button in the sidebar lets you export all results.
